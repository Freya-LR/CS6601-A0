class PriorityQueue(object):

    A queue structure where each element is served in order of priority.

    Elements in the queue are popped based on the priority with higher priority
    elements being served before lower priority elements.  If two elements have
    the same priority, they will be served in the order they were added to the
    queue.

    Traditionally priority queues are implemented with heaps, but there are any
    number of implementation options.

    (Hint: take a look at the module heapq)

    You may add extra helper functions within the class if you find them necessary.

        queue (list): Nodes added to the priority queue.
