# This assignment is meant to give you an idea of your general workflow,
# that you will be following for the next assignments. 
# 
# It'll help you get used to the systems, check your level of readiness 
# for the course and weed out setup problems early on.
# 
# The assignment description will be provided in an iPython notebook, 
# in which you can also write code. A good introduction to iPython can
#  be found at http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/core/notebook.html.
# 
# You will have an python file that you'll submit to our test server,
# Bonnie. The code that we will test against will be in this file. 
# Any code in the iPython notebook is meaningless from the testing 
# perspective.
# 
# With that, welcome to CS 6601: Artificial Intelligence.
# 
# You should ideally take no more than 15 minutes, to finish the 
# following exercises.

# This file is your main submission that will be graded against. Only copy-paste
# code on the relevant classes included here from the IPython notebook. Do not
# add any classes or functions to this file that are not part of the classes
# that we want.
